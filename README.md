# **NPRI Project: Predicting Trends of Ethanol and Methanol Releases (2023)**
## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the trends of ethanol and methanol releases in Canada using data from the National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI). The goal is to identify patterns, evaluate trends, and forecast releases for 2023. This analysis supports understanding environmental impacts and compliance monitoring.

## **Features**
* Data Extraction: Acquired release data of ethanol and methanol from the NPRI dataset.
* Data Cleaning: Processed raw data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized historical trends and correlations between variables.
* Trend Prediction: Developed predictive models to forecast release levels for 2023.
* Key Insights: Highlighted industries and facilities contributing to significant releases.
## **Tools and Technologies**
* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries:
pandas, numpy (Data manipulation)
seaborn, matplotlib (Visualization)
scikit-learn (Modeling)
statsmodels (Time-series analysis)
* Environment: Jupyter Notebook
## **Project Workflow**
* Data Acquisition: Retrieved data from the NPRI online database.
* Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned and transformed the data into an analysis-ready format.
* Handled categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
* Exploratory Data Analysis:
Examined the historical data (e.g., 2010â€“2022) to identify trends and seasonality.
Used correlation plots to analyze relationships between factors.
* Predictive Modeling:
Built and evaluated time-series and regression models (e.g., ARIMA, Random Forest).
Selected the best model for accurate prediction of 2023 releases.
* Results Interpretation:
Generated visualizations and a dashboard summarizing findings.
Provided actionable recommendations for reducing pollutant releases.
## **Key Results**
* Predicted increases/decreases in ethanol and methanol releases in 2023.
* Identified industries with significant contributions to pollutant levels.
* Offered insights into the effectiveness of current regulatory measures.
